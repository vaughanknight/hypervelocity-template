ALWAYS adhere to the ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in the /adr folder.  When making code edits please be sure to create those edits in line with the ADRs.  

ALWAYS refer to the documents in the /docs folder and subfolders across the codebase to inform yourself of the project and API specifications (/docs/specifications) and other documentation.

ALWAYS let me know when the project is diverting from the agreed ADRs so we can either create new ADRs or ensure we align.  ALWAYS ensure ADR's have a json representation of your reasoning at the bottom to make it easier for you to interpret in the future.

Please create ADRs for significant architectural decisions you are making.  Ensure the prompt is in the ADR ONLY if a prompt was used to create the ADR.  We can always REJECT the ADR suggestions you make which will help you make even more aligned decisions and avoid making those mistakes again.  However, we may resurface ADRs that didn't apply before (so were rejected) that we may want to change those decisions.

OCCASIONALLY I may ask you to look at file size length, please ensure you notify me if you think files are getting too long or complicated so we can refactor.  DO NOT make changes for these reasons without asking me first.
