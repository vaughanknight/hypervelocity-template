ALWAYS adhere to the ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in the /adr folder.  When making code edits please be sure to create those edits in line with the ADRs.

ALWAYS refer to the documents in the /docs folder and subfolders across the codebase when inform yourself of the project and API specifications (/docs/specifications) and other documentation.

ALWAYS let me know when the project is diverting from the agreed ADRs so we can either create new ADRs or ensure we align.
