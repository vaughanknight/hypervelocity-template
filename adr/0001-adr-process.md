# ADR 0001: Architecture Decision Records Process

## Status
Accepted

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
As our project evolves, we need a way to document important architectural decisions made by the team. These decisions often have significant impact on the codebase and need to be documented for future reference.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a lightweight approach to documenting architectural decisions, the context in which they were made, and their consequences.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records to document significant architectural decisions in the project. The ADR process will follow these guidelines:

1. **Format**: Each ADR will use the following format:
   - **Title**: Concise description of the decision
   - **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, or Superseded
   - **Date**: When the ADR was created or last updated
   - **Context**: The forces at play, including technological, business, and team considerations
   - **Decision**: The response to these forces, stated clearly
   - **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision

2. **Workflow**:
   - New ADRs are created with a status of "Proposed"
   - ADRs are discussed by the team and stakeholders
   - Once consensus is reached, the ADR status is changed to "Accepted" or "Rejected"
   - If an ADR is later replaced, its status becomes "Superseded" with a reference to the new ADR
   - If an ADR is no longer relevant, its status becomes "Deprecated"

3. **Numbering**:
   - ADRs will be numbered sequentially (e.g., 0001, 0002, etc.)
   - Numbers will not be reused, even if an ADR is rejected or deprecated

4. **Storage**:
   - ADRs will be stored as Markdown files in the `/adr` directory
   - Filename format: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` where `NNNN` is the ADR number

## Consequences
- Team members and new contributors will have a clear record of architectural decisions and their rationales
- Decision-making becomes more transparent and collaborative
- Future architectural changes can be more easily evaluated in the context of past decisions
- There will be some overhead in maintaining and updating these documents
- ADRs, once accepted, should be considered immutable historical records
- When architectural decisions change, a new ADR should be created rather than modifying existing ones
- Previous ADRs affected by new decisions should be marked as "Deprecated" or "Superseded" with references to the new ADR that replaces them
- This approach preserves the historical decision trail and ensures clarity about when and why architectural changes occurred
